# V2.2 Upgrade

### Prerequisites

1. Truffle Deployer Key ("Deployer Key")
2. Proxy Admin Key ("Admin Key")

### Steps

1. Ensure that the `config.js` file in the project root folder is configured
   with the correct values. The environment variables `PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS`,
   `PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` must be defined.

2. Ensure that the `NETWORK` that the contracts are to be deployed to are
   defined in [`./truffle-config.js`](../truffle-config.js).

3. Run Truffle migrations using the Deployer Key, and get the address of the
   newly deployed `V2_2Upgrader` contract.

   ```
   $ yarn migrate:v2_2 --network ${NETWORK}
   ...
   ...
   Dry-run successful. Do you want to proceed with real deployment?  >> (y/n): y
   ...
   ...
   >>>>>>> Deployed V2_2Upgrader at 0x12345678 <<<<<<<
   ```

4. Verify that the upgrader contract is deployed correctly. Verify that the
   values returned by `proxy()`, `implementation()` and `newProxyAdmin()` on the
   `V2_2Upgrader` contract are correct.

5. Verify that the `V2_2UpgraderHelper` contract is deployed correctly. Retrieve
   the address from the `V2_2Upgrader` contract `helper()` method, and verify
   that the return values of each view methods correspond with the
   `FiatTokenProxy` contract to be upgraded.

6. Using the Admin Key, transfer the proxy admin role to the `V2_2Upgrader`
   contract address by calling `changeAdmin(address)` method on the
   `FiatTokenProxy` contract.

7. Send 0.20 USDC to the `V2_2Upgrader` contract address. (200,000 tokens)

8. Using the Deployer Key, call `upgrade()` (`0xd55ec697`) method on the
   `V2_2Upgrader`.

#### IF THE UPGRADE TRANSACTION SUCCEEDS

- Verify that the proxy admin role is transferred back to the Admin Key.
- No further action needed.

#### IF THE UPGRADE TRANSACTION FAILS

- If the transaction fails, any state change that happened during the `upgrade`
  function call will be reverted.
- Call `abortUpgrade()` (`0xd8f6a8f6`) method on the `V2_2Upgrader` contract to
  tear it down.
